# minishell
In this project, we will go all the way back to the most essential. We will implement a way to make it possible to communicate with a computer via a shell.

# TODO

Several minishell testers will test for different things and it's not mostly not quite possible to get correct results for two different ones at the same time. On the other hand, cmd exit codes and other things can vary depending on the system they are on. This makes it so this program, mostly working in my machine, needs to be checked at the 42 computers for verification. It also makes it so that the final version of this program should be checked and made in 42 itself.
